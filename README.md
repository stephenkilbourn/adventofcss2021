## Description
This repo contains a custom landing page displaying the 24 completed solutions to the [Advent of CSS](https://www.adventofcss.com/) and [Advent of JS](https://www.adventofjs.com/) challenges for December 2021.  All solutions are done in HTML, CSS, and JS without extra frameworks. Some, but not all, have been expanded to include both mobile and desktop friendly layouts.

The scheme and design of the landing page are my own work.
